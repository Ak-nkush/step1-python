x = 10 
y = x 
print( x , " " , y)

x = 15 
print( x , " " , y) 

# as we know that integer is immutable data , because we are creating the memory container that contains the values of x and y , we can't change the values at the memory location like we do in array or here we can say it as list . We can just point the variable to another memory location thats we are calling as modification of variable
